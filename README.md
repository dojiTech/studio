# Task Management App

This is a simple task management application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a Node.js/Express backend for AI functionality.

Previously, this project was a Next.js application. It has been converted to demonstrate building a task list with core web technologies.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Open your terminal in the project directory.
3. Install the backend dependencies:


## How to Run

To run this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.


Here's a summary of what we've done and what's still needed:

What we've done:

Created index.html for the main page structure.
Created style.css for basic styling.
Created script.js for front-end logic (adding, completing, deleting tasks, calling AI endpoint).
Created package.json and server.js to set up a basic Node.js/Express backend server.
Added a placeholder API endpoint (/suggest-tasks) in server.js.
Added a button in index.html and logic in script.js to call the AI endpoint.
Removed files related to the previous framework (Next.js, React, etc.).
What's still needed:

Implement AI Logic in the Backend: You need to replace the placeholder logic in the /suggest-tasks endpoint in server.js with your actual AI code from the src/ai/ directory. This involves:

Examining the code in src/ai/ to understand how it works and what functions are relevant for generating task suggestions.
Importing and calling the necessary AI functions within the /suggest-tasks endpoint.
Ensuring the data is passed correctly between the front-end and backend.
Refine Front-end AI Integration:

Displaying Suggestions: Currently, the AI suggestions are just shown in an alert. You'll likely want to display them in a more user-friendly way on the page (e.g., in a dedicated section, a modal, or as suggested tasks that can be added to the main list).
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling for the API call in script.js to provide feedback to the user if something goes wrong.
Loading State: Add a visual indicator (e.g., a loading spinner) while waiting for the AI response.
Add More Advanced Styling: Enhance style.css to improve the visual appearance of the app, making it more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

Implement Data Persistence: Currently, the task list is stored in memory and will be lost when the page is refreshed. To make the task list persistent, you need to implement a way to store the data:

Local Storage: For a simple app, you could use browser local storage to save and load tasks.
Database: For a more robust solution, you would typically use a database on the backend to store user data.
Add More Task Management Features: Consider adding features like:

Editing tasks
Setting due dates and priorities
Filtering and sorting tasks
User accounts and authentication (if needed)
Refactor and Organize Code: As you add more features, you might want to refactor your JavaScript code to make it more organized and maintainable, perhaps using modules or a more structured approach.

In summary, the most critical next step is to implement the actual AI logic in the backend server (server.js). After that, you can focus on improving the front-end integration of the AI suggestions and adding other desired features and styling.
